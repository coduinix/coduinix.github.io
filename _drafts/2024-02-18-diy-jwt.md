## Introduction
For a project I was working on we were working a lot with OIDC-related technology.

Somewhere in the project there was the need for an easy to use and easy to configure OIDC server mock.
We used Keycloak[^1], which is highly configurable, to act as an OIDC server for our end to end test needs.
This worked quite well.

But at some point we needed something which would be easy to _mock_ for our integration tests.
Googling around didn't reveal any lightweight, easy to configure mock OIDC server, so I decided to try to build one myself.
