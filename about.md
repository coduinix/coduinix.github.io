I'm a Java/Scala developer with a passion for clean code and software craftmanship. 
In my day-to-day job I work as a consultant for [SDB Professionals](https://sdbjava.nl/).

Over the years I've done a lot of Java and Scala coding.
I love to share my experience by doing pair programming, reviews, writing blogs and articles and occasionally giving talks.
