title: About me
---
I'm a programmer with over 15 years experience with Java. 
The last couple of years I'm enjoying the nice things the Scala programming language offers.

Switching to Scala teached me a lot about functional programming. 
I love explaining functional concepts both using Java and Scala examples.
